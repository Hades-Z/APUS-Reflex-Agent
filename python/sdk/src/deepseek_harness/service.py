"""HTTP surface for driving this harness from another process.

An evaluator runs outside this container and needs to hand work in and read
results back over the network. The harness already speaks JSON-RPC to its own
child process, but that transport is stdio and assumes a local parent; this
module wraps the same SDK in a small HTTP server so the harness can be a
long-lived service that other containers address by URL.

Only the standard library is used: the SDK's dependency list is pydantic and
the runtime binary, and a web framework for four routes would be a new
platform choice this package does not otherwise make.
